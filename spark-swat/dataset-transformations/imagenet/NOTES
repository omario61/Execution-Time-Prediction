The original imagenet data is a directory of JPEG files.

The dataset we used is downloadable from:

http://image-net.org/image/ILSVRC2015/ILSVRC2015_DET_test.tar.gz

This downloads the full dataset, you should simply place the JPEG files under
$SPARK_DATASETS/imagenet/0.original.

You should then run the scripts in this directory in the order indicated by
their numbering.

If 0.find_min_image_size.sh reports errors for some files, delete them from your
filesystem. There should not be many, but this may indicate corrupted JPEGs
which your JVM installation cannot read. You likely will also want to delete any
oddly small files (e.g. ones reported as having a height and width of 1).

The convert_jpeg_to_txt.sh script uses the ConvertJPEGsToText to convert each
JPEG file containing N pixels to a text file containing a single space-separated
line where each element on the line is either the R, G, or B component of a
pixel in the original image. This output is placed in 1.txt.

The convert_txt_to_densevector.sh script uses the ImagenetConverter class to
convert each of those single-line text files to a Tuple2[Int, DenseVector] where
the integer is a unique ID for the dense vector parsed from the text file. This
output is placed in 2.converted.
