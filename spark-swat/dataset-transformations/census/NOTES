The original census data is formatted as a CSV file. Each row starts with a
unique ID for the data point, and is followed by a series of comma-separated
values representing different attributes for this data point.

The census CSV file can be downloaded from:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census1990-mld/USCensus1990.data.txt

Start by placing it at $SPARK_DATASETS/census/0.original/USCensus1990.data.txt
and removing the first header row. Then run the scripts in this directory in the
order indicated by their numbering.

I generally run 2.dup.sh with 10 duplicates.

The output is an RDD[DenseVector] representing each of the input data points as
a single vector.
